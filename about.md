# Get involved!

We invite philosophers, architects, thinkers, entrepreneurs, adventurers, free-to-learners, collaborators... 
 
There are a few ways you can get involved with EarthSkyLab. We have created a [Blog](blog.html), which we invite everyone to contribute to and share your knowledge and thoughts about the Questions and themes we have raised in EarthSkyLab Vision. 
 
We are in the process of forming working groups focused on specific areas. We invite you to take part and collaborate with us on exploring the vision and bringing it into the world. Please express your interest by sending us an email. 

In 2016 we will organise an EarthSkyLab Summit 2016 will be organized in a locatin yet to be decided and there will be more information online.

And of course get in touch if you are considering joining EarthSkyLab and moving to the land.

## CALL FOR BLOG CONTRIBUTION - share your knowledge and thoughts. 

## Village planning working group

Creating a model concept design for what EarthSkyLab could be laid out as is a fun, exciting and important part of the design process. Of course when we find the land we will need to adjust to itâ€™s particular topography and characteristics, still starting the discussion now on how to position community buildings and houses. Village planning working group aims to answer the following questions:

How to create a village layout which fosters community interaction?
What are the shared spaces which the community needs? 
How to create a village layout aligned with our values and goals?
What spaces can we create for the community to get together? 
What are the spaces we need for discussion, meditation, for festivals and celebration?


## Organisation & Business Plan working group

We need a team to create an organisation plan describing clearly the ownership structure, decision making, etc. We need to draft the articles of the constitution for the legal entity. We need to create a model of how  community finances will be handled. We need to create agreements about community service. 


## Free-to-learn community working group

The idea of creating a community which is centered around the free-to-learn principle for both children and adults is perhaps the most novel part of the whole EarthSkyLab Vision. We are looking for help from everyone in the alternative-learning movement to help us develop the details of how to turn vision into reality.

# EarthSkyLab Summit 2016
The EarthSkyLab Summit is a temporary community focused on developing the EarthSkyLab model. We will discuss, exchange ideas and make plans for implementing the EarthSkyLab vision. We will create community documents, work on business models, imagine community celebrations, make beautiful things and build future plans. We will work, cook, eat, sing, create and celebrate together.
