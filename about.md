## Village planning working group

Creating a model concept design for what EarthSkyLab could be laid out as is a fun,  exciting and important part of the design process. Of course when we find the land we will need to adjust to itâ€™s particular topography and characteristics, still starting the discussion now on how to position community buildings and houses. 

### Questions
How to create a village layout which fosters community interaction?
What are the shared spaces which the community needs? 
How to create a village layout aligned with our values and goals?
What spaces can we create for the community to get together? 
What are the spaces we need for discussion, meditation, for festivals and celebration?


## Organisation & Business Plan working group

We need a team to create an organisation plan describing clearly the ownership structure, decision making, etc. We need to draft the articles of the constitution for the legal entity. We need to create a model of how  community finances will be handled. We need to create agreements about community service.
