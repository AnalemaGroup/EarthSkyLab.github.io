# What is EarthSkyLab?

EarthSkyLab is a newly forming [intentional community](/pages/03 VISION/01 COMMUNITY/40 Creative Intentional Community.html) based on a culture of [collaboration](/pages/02 VALUES/60 Collaboration.html), creativity, [free-to-learn/unschooling, life-long learning](/pages/02 VALUES/10 Life-long Free-to-learn.html) and [celebration](/pages/02 VALUES/80 Celebration.html). 

Living together in Nature we will establish a deeply connected community which is culturally rich, has a healthy commons, is economically successful and participating in modern society in a conscious, creative and sustainable way. 

Based on principles of [empathic communication](/pages/02 VALUES/40 Empathic Communication.html), [openness and transparency](/pages/02 VALUES/50 Openness & Transparency.html), [sharing](/pages/01 COMMUNITY/70 Organization Ownership Sharing.html) and [collaboration](/pages/02 VALUES/60 Collaboration.html), we will live in [harmony](/pages/02 VALUES/20 Harmony.html) with each other and with Nature, [contributing our model of community to the commons](/pages/01 QUESTIONS/50 How to create a community model reproducible by others.html).

With strong emphasis on the values of [celebration](/pages/02 VALUES/80 Celebration.html), [grattitude](/pages/02 VALUES/70 Gratitude.html) and [harmony](/pages/02 VALUES/20 Harmony.html) we open space for a new way of life to emerge based on universal principles for a happy, healthy co-existence of humans.

Today our core team is searching for land and creating a detailed action plan to bring EarthSkyLab to life. We need your help!
