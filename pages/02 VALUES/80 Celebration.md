There is something out of ordinary during celebration, there is space where time itself is transcended and we have gone beyond “normality” and familiar. There is a sense of renewal and a sense of mystery. During celebrations we focus on the human and natural cycles which need to be recognized. Celebration makes us mindful of these cycles connecting us to nature, to the cycle of life, connecting us to the universe. We offer our gratitudes to each other and to the Universe and put intentions into our celebration ceremonies. These moments create a potential for transformation of individual and community bonding.
