Why questions? We believe that questions are more fundamental than answers. It is not possible to have an informed discussion about the answer if we arenâ€™t all considering the same question.  Thus a presentation of ideas with the hope of sparking fruitful discussion must necessarily start with a statement of what questions are under consideration.

We must reach a shared understanding of the questions before beginning discussion of possible answers.
Each word in the questions is intended to spark reflection and discussion: Community? Culture?Collaboration? Each question a source of further questions.
