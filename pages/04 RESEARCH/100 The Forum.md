The forum is a group communication method developed by Zegg and Tamera communities. It is said to foster a very open and positive community environment. The Forum is a relatively new technique, requiring highly skilled facilitators and a very deep level of transparency from all members thus perhaps it is hard to put into practice. Research is required to see if or in what situations it is appropriate.
