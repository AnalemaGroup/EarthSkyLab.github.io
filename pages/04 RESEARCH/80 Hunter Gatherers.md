Homo-sapiens spent the first 95% of itâ€™s history in small hunter-gatherer tribes, our ancestors before that a few million years. Thus living in such a small close-knit, egalitarian, supportive group is our natural state of being. We do not romanticise or intend to return to the days before medicine and the internet however we do believe there is much to be learned about human relations in community from this longest part of our history.
