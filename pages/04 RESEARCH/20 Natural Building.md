EarthSkyLab is going to be a community of beautiful homes harmoniously integrated into the landscape. Natural Building offers the most promising path towards achieving this at a low financial cost whilst creating buildings which will last centuries. Appropriate techniques have to be researched, what is appropriate for the climate, what techniques allow for reducing energy consumption, etc.
Natural Building has lower material costs but requires a higher labour input than conventional building techniques, as we support each other in community this should be a happy trade-off for us.
