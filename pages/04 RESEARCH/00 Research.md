Creating a new model for human community is an epic undertaking, fortunately there is a long history for us to learn from. Epicurean communities in ancient greece, Quakers, Kibbutz, eco-villages and the intentional communities, there is a rich basis of experience for us to learn from. We will make mistakes no doubt, but let us at least start with an understanding of the learnings of those who came before us.
The goal of this research is to collect ideas and best practices into a shared-knowledge base for all EarthSkyLab community members.
