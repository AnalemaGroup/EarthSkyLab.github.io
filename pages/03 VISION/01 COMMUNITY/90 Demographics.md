EarthSkyLab is a a fully intergenerational community designed to make people of all ages feel equally at home. From the smallest children to the oldest citizens EarthSkyLab is an environment welcoming to all. We will consciously think of infants, children and the elderly in the design of the village.
In order to create a community which is supportive of the elderly we need to include elder members from the early days of the community.
For the long-term survival of the community we will need to consciously engineer the demographic balance. With such a small population it is easy to fall into a situation where everyone becomes old at the same time and the village fades away.
For the long-term survival of the community this perhaps will be the most difficult thing to plan.
