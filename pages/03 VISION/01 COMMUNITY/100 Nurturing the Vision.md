The health and vibrancy of the community depends on nurturing the EarthSkyLab vision in the hearts and minds of the community. A shared living vision which is continually renewed. EarthSkyLab celebrations are an integral part of our vision process. We consciously endeavour to share the EarthSkyLab vision with our children, new members, with each other and the world. We create practices which synchronise everything we do with the vision.
