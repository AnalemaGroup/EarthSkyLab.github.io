EarthSkyLab will welcome many visitors. Our extended families, our friends, our collaborators, we are all globally connected and EarthSkyLab is also intended as a retreat for our extended community. A place where we can bring our collaborators and for a time work together closely. However EarthSkyLab is not a rental event center or a curiosity for day visitors, all visitors are considered temporary community members with corresponding rights and obligations.
Once a year we will open our doors and create a festival for invited guests. A festival focused not on consumption but on collaborative co-creation. No spectators!
