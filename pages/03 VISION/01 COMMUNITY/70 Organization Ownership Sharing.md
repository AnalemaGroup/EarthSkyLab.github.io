A key goal of EarthSkyLab is to create a good balance of private ownership, sharing and community commons. We believe that by creating a rich “community commons” - that is resources owned together by the whole community with fair access for all, we will enable an abundant lifestyle for all, whilst requiring less resources than modern city life. Co-working, children and youth spaces, studios and of course centrally - The Garden, all these will be part of the community commons.

## Legal structure & Land Ownership

The community is a registered legal entity. This legal entity owns all the land, community buildings and communal property. 
The best legal structure needs to be researched, quite likely it will be a non-profit entity as this sends a clear message as to the purpose of the entity and makes it possible to accept certain government grants, tax benefits, etc. The country of registration also needs to be researched however it is expected that an entity in the country where the community is located will make most sense.

## One citizen one vote
Every full-citizen of the community becomes an equal partner in the legal organisation. It is likely that at the start some community members will be able to invest more money or more time into the community, this needs to be accounted for but it will not give them greater voting rights than other members. The extra funds can be either given as a gift to the community or as a loan to be repaid when other members enter the community.

## Community budget
Community has a basic budget to which everyone contributes equally for providing for essential community infrastructure. Community budget will be decided through the decision making processes. Costs for utilities such as electricity or studios is assigned on a usage basis. All of the community budget will be transparently open to all members. The goal is to keep the mandatory contribution to the budget reasonable. 
## Leaving the community
The details of how members’ funds are returned when they leave will be decided at the time the legal entity is created. The most viable option is that a newly incoming family will buy out the share of the leaving family. The valuation of this after many years of contribution is very hard. When creating the legal entity we will create a valuation formula which is reasonable. The key point is that community-membership is not freely tradeable, the community chooses candidates for incoming members and everyone must go through an initial trial period and after that be accepted by the community.

## Children & Inheritance 
Every citizen of the community must go through the same trial period and membership process. This includes children of the community. While children of members can inherit the membership in the community they must nevertheless pass through the membership process. In the rare case they are not accepted for membership in the community the “leaving the community” agreement takes effect.
## Community Sharing
In addition to the commons we want to create a strong sharing culture within the community encouraging members to make their private resources available for the use by other community members. For example specialised tools or cars or spouses, etc. In order to facilitate this sharing within the community will have a system for  tracking of shared resources and  time-banking.
