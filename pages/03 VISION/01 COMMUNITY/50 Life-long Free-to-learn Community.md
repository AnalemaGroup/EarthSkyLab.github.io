We understand that mastery starts from first small step. But we are also aware that mastery is a path filled with audacious experimentation and continuous remasterings of one’s own personal story in the light of larger processes. There is no limit to how deep one should follow one’s passion and how many unexpected turns can be taken. We encourage learning experience free from constrictions of mainstream education system - a self-directed, responsible and fulfilling experience, driven by inner necessity and the spark of creativity rather than obligatory curriculum and imposed uniformity. 

Free-to-learn approach encourages healthy attitude to failure as a necessary and integral part of the learning process. From fear of failure to embracing change and finding creative opportunity in every circumstance, we expand perception of what achievements, success and sense of fulfilment are. 

EarthSkyLab will work together to create a supportive learning environment for everyone, from the youngest child to the most elderly member. Each of us willing to be student, teacher, coach or learning peer. Eager to learn new skills and ideas, eager to share what we know.

To create a rich learning environment for children and youth all community members must be open and engaged, willing to share what they know. As free-to-learn is a founding pillar of EarthSkyLab, all EarthSkyLab children will free-to-learn in the community.

Creating a free-to-learn community is still a very new idea so this is an area we will be pioneers in. We will network widely with other free to learn communities to share best practices and give our children a map of places they can visit and collaborate with.

Life-long-learning means that all community members devote a part of their time to learning new skills and sharing what they learn with the community. This includes skills important for the community and it’s members enterprises such as permaculture, natural building, wood crafts, web marketing, software design, ceramics, communication, mindfulness, emotional intelligence, leadership, organisation, coaching etc.
