The process for becoming a citizen of EarthSkyLab will be clearly formalised. 
Acceptance into the community will require unanimous consensus of all existing members. First there will be a one year trial period. In order to create a shared frame of reference all citizens will study key community skills. The details of these will be decided in the forming days of the community but are expected to include sociocracy and empathic communication. There will be a set of shared readings and the most important skills will require taking courses.
In order to ensure new members share the EarthSkyLab vision they will be asked to write about how they understand it, how they see themselves fitting into the community and how they think the vision should evolve in the future. 
Of course entering the trial period, entering the community are wonderfully joyous occasions and will be celebrated by the community!
