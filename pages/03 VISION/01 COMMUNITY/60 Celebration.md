Celebration creates connection in community. As we eat, dance, sing and attain extraordinary states together we create deep human bonds. Celebration creates not just time together but time out of the ordinary. Peak experiences creating shared moments and memories to last a lifetime.
Celebration is how we express our gratitude to life, earth and each other. Celebration is how we mark the passage of seasons, seasons of nature and of our lives. 
In EarthSkyLab every celebration is a festival, an art performance, an experience accepting no spectators. Creating our own calendar of festivals. Celebrating nature’s seasons, each other’s lives and the community’s joint achievements.

*	Long cycle events - once every 5, 10, 25, 50, 100  years cycles, or some such - maybe Mayan calendar cycle

# Potlatch - Celebrating each other’s success
Potlatch events are created by members when they want to share their wealth with the community. It enables us to celebrate each other’s success and have the whole community benefit. An EarthSkyLab Potlatch could be just a shared party or a member buying equipment, building materials or even land for the community.
EarthSkyLab Potlatch culture enables members to voluntarily share their surplus wealth with the community hopefully preventing wealth differences to grow into unhealthy levels. At the same time it encourages members to help each other as all successes are shared.
