<i>So that we can Imagine, Design, Create, Play, Decide, Collaborate, Celebrate, Cook, Eat, Share, Learn, Garden, Build, Dance, Laugh, Cry, Live and Meditate together in Joy, Gratitude, Beauty, Nature, Harmony</i>

Because we believe that with conscious design we can create a better world, a better home, a better life for ourselves. Because we believe that the only way can do this is together, as a community. Because we see that we have reached the limits of individual struggle, the limits of what we can achieve within the framework of the existing system. Because we think that this is the right time to live the life we have dreamt of. 

<i>We can create a better world.</i>

A life of meaningful and deep interaction with people we care about. A rich nurturing environment for children. A beautiful natural environment. A life full of art and craft. A life lived in a deeply connected community of skilled, passionate and dedicated people. A life with a shared vision, a new kind of sustainable community. A life lived together with friends who are passionate about creating beauty in the world. A community garden bringing abundance to all. A place where craftsmen, artists, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, marketers can collaborate and cross-pollinate without limitations. 

<i>A new way of life is possible.</i>

We believe that through conscious effort we can improve ourselves, our lives, and our relationships. We believe we can learn from those who came before us and build on their wisdom and experience. We want to contribute to humanity's holistic progress. We believe that humanity needs a new model of a deeply connected small community. A model for living in harmony with each other,  nature and modernity.
We understand that life long learning gives a happier more fulfilled life.  We know we can learn to master our emotional states. We think that in order for the community to continually renew itself itâ€™s members must continue to learn.

<i>Time is Now!</i>

We believe The Time Is Now: The progress of our virtual lives, the lowering of life-quality, rising real estate prices and degrading mental-health conditions in the city. The commoditization of our food supply. The difficulty of raising children in the big city. Our growing distance from nature. The worries about stability of basic national and global economic structures. The availability of cheap land in many wonderful corners of the world. Our growing realisation of what needs to be done. Our growing network of friends and supporters.  Clearly, the time is now.
For centuries our celebrations have become captured, institutionalised first by religions then by consumerism. Idols attached themselves to our festivals sapping their power. Celebrations losing their raw human spirit, this power taken away from the people, weakening communities.  The time has come to reclaim celebrations from churches and corporations and give their power back to the community.

<i>We are adventure.</i>

We love adventure and love big challenges. We know that it will bring us joy much above the effort it will require.
