The purpose of EarthSkyLab is to create a deeply connected community of close relationships, sharing and mutual support. Learning from hunter gatherer tribes, recent research in human psychology and the communities which have come before us we believe that the optimal size for this is 10-15 families. EarthSkyLab will not grow beyond this size. Instead EarthSkyLab will expand by creating an extended family of sister communities. Our dream is to create an open model for community which others can easily copy, to create a world-wide network of like-minded communities. A network we can share ideas, learnings, and best-practices with. A network of free-to-learn communities our children can  travel to and collaborate with.
