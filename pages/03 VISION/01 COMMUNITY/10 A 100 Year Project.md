In order to create a  grand but not grandiose frame for the project we are viewing this as a 100 year project. Of course after that we hope it will continue for a long time, but it is out of our planning horizon. Perhaps those who do the evaluation of this 100 year plan can then go on to make a 1,000 year plan. We will strive to create a world to enable them to do this.  A 100 years is a reasonable timeframe to grow a forest, and we expect to have to plant one. It takes this much to regenerate an exhausted natural environment. It takes a 100 years to really see and appreciate the impact of a grand social experiment.
At the same time we hope that creating this goal, and evaluating ourselves against it will bring benefit to our planning and sharing of knowledge with others.
