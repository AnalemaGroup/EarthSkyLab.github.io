Empathic communication is the basis of all the relations within EarthSkyLab. Being an Intentional Community means all members make a conscious effort to improve their communication skills.

We will govern ourselves using a clearly defined fair and participatory processes for decision making, assigning responsibilities and process change. We will document our agreements, as well as the discussions which led to them. We start with sociocracy as the basis and fine-tune it to best suit our community. We strive to proactively discuss and improve all our processes including these for decision making and governance.

We strive to share our learnings and best practices, contributing them to the global knowledge commons.

We recognise that effective decision making requires emotional maturity and empathic communication from all community citizens.
Following sociocratic rules our agreements include review dates. When the founding group assembles a number of long-term agreements will be made forming the constitution of the community.

EarthSkyLab in this first iteration is planned as a 100 year project, thus the fundamental agreements will have a 100 year review date. It is our hope that they will be useful enough to be renewed, we leave our descendants the decision whether to continue or make new covenants. 

As a modern community we will use appropriate online and offline technology to enable effective participation by all members in discussion, decision making and governance.

It is possible that as need and opportunity arises we will modify or create software for intentional community to support us and enable others to follow The EarthSkyLab Model easily.

We recognise that Governance and Decision Making are just a few of the processes needed for a successful intentional community, we put equal emphasis on healthy communication and maintaining the vision.
