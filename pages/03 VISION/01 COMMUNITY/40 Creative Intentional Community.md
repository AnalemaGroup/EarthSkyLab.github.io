	*	Communication (NVC, circle-way/forum, etc.)
	*	Celebration
	*	Creating together
	*	Gardening together
*	Sustainable and meaningful lifestyle
	*	Economically vibrant - we create wealth for sustainable and comfortable lifestyle
	*	Culturally & communally vibrant
 *	A place where our children and their children will want to live 
*	Repeatable
	*	We document our learnings and share our model with the world
*	Size: 10-35 adults, 5-15 households
