In the long run each community member will spend one day a week on community  tasks such as governance, maintaining the garden, the land, our commons and shared infrastructure. Of course this does not include time spent on celebrations!  The goal is not to focus on time accounting and enforcement but to create a deep community spirit where contribution to the common good is a joy, this is a key motivation for keeping EarthSkyLab small. We hope to organise as much as possible of the community service as group activities to ensure it is a joyful time. The goal is to organise activities so that the community can be maintained through members community service contribution exclusively without any paid positions. Of course many members will choose to contribute much more of their time to the community, we will create rituals and celebrations to recognise their contribution.

Although we will help each other build and collaborate on each otherâ€™s businesses this is not considered community service.
