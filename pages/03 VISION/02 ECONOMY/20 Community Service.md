In the long run each community member will spend one day a week on community support tasks such as governance, maintaining the garden and the commons. Of course this does not include time spent on celebrations! The community charter will specify how much time each member is expected to contribute. LOVE & JOY However the goal is not to focus on accounting but to create a community 
Since this creates complicated dynamics which tend towards the negative EarthSkyLab will not have paid positions for community members. The goal is to organise activities such that the community can take care of all it's needs through members community service contribution. Of course many members will choose to contribute much more of their time to the community, we will create rituals and celebrations to recognise their contribution.
Community service would include:

*	Building and maintaining the community shared buildings and infrastructure
*	Maintaining The Garden,  food forest, and land

Note: that while we will help each other build our houses, and collaborate on each otherâ€™s businesses this is not community service.
