The Garden, our shared source of joy and abundance.  We nurture it happily as a communal activity and we accept itâ€™s gifts with gratitude. We are gardeners but not farmers. We tend to our garden with joy as a community activity, not an attempt at self-sufficiency. The garden is the space for contemplation, getting in touch with nature, learning about the source of our life. We do not sell or trade the gifts of our land but, when we can, we gift food to our extended community and those who need it. We create harmonious permaculture designs holistically integrated into the landscape.
