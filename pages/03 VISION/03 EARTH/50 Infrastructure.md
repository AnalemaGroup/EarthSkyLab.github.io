In order to get a large plot of land at a reasonable price EarthSkyLab will most likely be located in a somewhat remote area, thus we will necessarily need to create much of our own infrastructure. At the same time in order to create a degree of independence from the global economy having our own electrical and water grid will be advantageous. Furthermore local energy generation creates ecological benefits.
 
# Internet 
EarthSkyLab will provide a minimum of 1 Mbps down, 0.5 Mbps up for every community resident. If at all possible we would like 4Mbps down & 1Mbps up for every resident.

# Electricity
Whilst electricity generation through solar has become very price effective, local storage is much less efficient. Thus ideally we would like to have a connection to the grid for night-time and feeding in any generated surplus. Research needs to be done on what is feasible.
EarthSkyLab will share a community-wide micro-grid but electricity usage will be metered. 

# Water
In order to provide a good water supply we will need a property with good water catchment, a spring and wells. Appropriate sharing and metering scheme needs to be investigated.

# Road 
The road to the property will be maintained together by the community.

# Sewerage 
Sewage management technology needs to be investigated.
