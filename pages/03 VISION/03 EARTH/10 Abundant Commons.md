EarthSkyLab is built on a vision of an abundant community commons. By sharing more we create great abundance for all.  We share equally the gifts of our land - all food grown on our land is distributed equally amongst the community members. EarthSkyLab has many shared workshops and studios. For privately owned items we have a Sharing network enabling easy sharing of resources within the community. As part of the life-long learning ethos everyone shares their knowledge freely within the community. Our land the foundation of a rich commons including the garden, food forest, wilderness and sacred spaces. 

# Shared space: Co-working
A the shared co-working space is at the heart of the community. A building with ample co-working space for all the community members, meeting rooms and other facilities. Making a living in the modern world necessitates much online time, collaborating with virtual teams. Being in a shared space gives the camaraderie which the virtual world does not adequately provide. Being in close proximity makes it easier to collaborate within the community and support each other.
This area is located close to the children's area to allow everyone to work whilst caring for the children.

# Shared space: Childrenâ€™s and youth spaces
The community will create spaces which are for, and administered exclusively by the children and youth. These gives them areas exclusively of their own, a playground to practice autonomy and collaboration.

# Shared space: Workshops  
EarthSkyLab will have shared studios and workshops for woodworking, pottery, sewing, metalwork and more with a balance of traditional and modern equipment. Some spaces will be used mostly by a particular member to earn an income, however all spaces will be accessible on a reasonable basis for use by any community member. Skilled community members will strive to creating learning opportunities for all. Some specialist equipment be perhaps be owned by individual members, but will be made available for borrowing through the sharing network. 

# Shared Space: The Garden
See section on garden.

# Shared space: Wilderness and food forest
The greater part of our land will be a wilderness designed to create local ecological diversity. A part of the land will also be designed as a permaculture food forest. 
A forest takes decades to reach full size and hundreds of years to develop, but it will provide abundance for generations to come.

# Shared space: Meditation spaces, sacred forest sanctuary, sacred spaces
EathSkyLab will have sacred spaces reserved for community, group and individual meditation and rituals.
