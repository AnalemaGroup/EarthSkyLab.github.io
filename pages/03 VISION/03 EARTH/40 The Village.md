Creating a home which is beautiful, harmonious balanced with nature is a the dream of EarthSkyLab. EarthSkyLab is a landscape designed to be beautiful, bountiful, easy to care for. An environment rich for us and a supporting environment for local flora and fauna. A balance of permaculture design and wilderness. A 100 year plan with an eye to the next 1,000.

# Sustainability
EarthSkyLab is a 100 year plan with an eye to the next 1,000. We intend to create an ecosystem and a community which will live and renew itself for a long time. We will work with experts in permaculture and sustainable design to create a plan which fits this vision. As with everything striving to share our learnings.
At the same time the goal is not just to survive but to create a thriving culturally rich community which continually renews itself thus the sustainability of human systems is main focus of our research.

# Natural Building
Natural Building fits with our values of formosa, harmony with nature and long-term sustainability.

# Village design
EarthSkyLab is designed for humans first. A place where all generations can feel completely safe. This means cars are kept outside the village. The center of the village is a shared community space, children's space, a place to meet, relax, celebrate. EarthSkyLab is designed for easy contact and interaction between members.

# Homes
Our homes are beautiful, and integrated into the landscape, each house with character but still fitting into the overall spirit of the village. To reduce our energy usage we will use the latest ecological techniques such as passive heating and cooling, etc.
