I am incredibly excited to publish online this first version of the EarthSkyLab Community Model. We have been thinking, researching, brainstorming and discussing this idea together with [Evgenia Emets](/authors/evgenia.html) for as long as we've known each other. I've talked about these ideas with many of my friends and I am immensely grateful for everyone's thoughts, comments, feedback and support.

Of course what we have written here is really just a series of ideas intended to spark discussion. This site is intended as a vessel to be filled with blog entries exploring these questions and refining the vision. 

We are publishing this vision as an open model. Starting a community is a huge task, there is so much to consider, plan and agree on. I think that by creating a clear, easy to follow model we can make this process much easier thus enabling many more people to create a deeply connected community.


As I think back on my life I realise that I have been on this journey towards finding a new model for community my whole life. Growing up in a newly built but soulless block-long apartment in socialist Warsaw I viscerally experienced the absence of community in modern urban living. My parents had many friends but we knew no-one in our building or neighbourhood. I instinctively knew such an environment is not natural, deleterious to mental health. I didn't understand it at the time, but remember feeling better visiting my fatherâ€™s hometown, being in a multi-generational house, surrounded by extended family and familiar neighbours.

Since then I have been fortunate to have a few experiences of a richer community-fabric: expatriate life in Kuwait, university in a small rural town in Canada, the early days of electronic music festivals, burningman. Alas these were but brief glimpses of the joy of community, fuelling my disillusionment with big-city life.

At the same time I have been fortunate to experience many quite different realities - socialist Poland, petro-dollar Kuwait, Canada, Silicon Valley, 14 years in Japan - all these experiences made me realise how much of our reality is just a social convention. Conventions can be changed, we can create a new reality for ourselves which is of our own design, of our own choosing.

I hope you join us on the journey towards imagining and creating this model for life in a deeply connected community for the 21st century!
