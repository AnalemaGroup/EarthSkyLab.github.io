We created the name EarthSkyLab to hold our ideas of community. It is intended as a temporary name to be used until we create a core team and find something better.
As all things in the universe, temporary it maybe nevertheless it carries within it the spirit of what we are trying to create.

# Earth
Earth, gaia, our mother, fragile blue ball flying through the universe, gently protected from the cold harshness of space by a thin layer of gas. The one and only planet we have, home. Earth is nature, evolution, agriculture. Earth is the dirt we came from and whence we shall all inevitably return. Earth is life.

# Sky
Sky is our connection to the universe. Sky is a reminder that no matter how smart, how rich whatever we think we can understand or control is but a mere point at the end of a pin of the wholeness of existence. Sky is a connection to the stars, those forges of atoms whence we all came. Sky is about perspective, sky is about the wonder of all we know, wonder at the incredible path the atoms of our bodies took to get to where they are today.

# Lab
Lab is a reminder that all of life is an experiment. Lab means that we know that everything we know is just a theory based on experiences, data and knowledge collected so far, an acknowledgement much will change as we learn and develop our conciousness further. Lab is about creativity, playfulness, there are no wrong answers and the more surprising the result the more valuable it maybe. Lab is about adventure, about trying new things, but it is also about being prepared for the journey and taking notes along the way. Lab is about having fun, enjoying the unexpected. Lab is about sharing our results and hoping that what we learn can in some way contribute towards the betterment of man-kind in the long run.
