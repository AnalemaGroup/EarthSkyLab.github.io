This mini Shibori making experience we have created is the first one we have done in London. It is continuing many Shibori experiences Victor has done whilst living in Japan. I have started dyeing cloth after he shared with me this fascinating and simple technique to making colorful cloth. We have decided to try Shibori as community experience, to enable everyone make their own first Shibori towel. Each participant would come out unique signatures, each would be a simple mono-colored pattern, using most basic technique of folding. Everyone would have a small functional object reminding them of this community experience. 

In the future we will create art and crafts experiences, collaborations between artists and crafts people, promote and sell these unique creations. Community members will participate in the workshops to learn techniques and create their own art crafts objects. We believe this is a fun, beautiful and productive way to bring our mind to a more holistic space and keep on learning making beautiful things with our own hands. - *Evgenia*

Shibori is an act of dying fabric by binding it into close knots. The resulting pattern is formed out of interesting shapes of various shades of the chosen color.

Me and my wife were invited to participate in the Shibori experience by Evgenia last winter. We gathered in the spatious house of Evgenia and Viktor, started communicating and using LAN cables and pegs to tie the fabric. Any communal work always binds not only towels but also people. Since the act of making something simple doesn't require any particular knowledge it becomes free, enjoyable and fun.

and waiting for the towels to be coloured we took them out of the pot to see these nice irregular pattern

The towels are in use! Perhaps it's time to make similar T-shirt. - *Ivan and Ekaterina*
