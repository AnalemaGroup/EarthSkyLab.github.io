Evgenia is a visionary multi-talented artist. Much of Evgenia's artistic work is based on collaboration, she is the founder of the artists collective Analema Group. Thanks to her wide-ranging experiences she has gained a deep understanding of the power and challenges of democratic collaboration. 

Evgenia is dedicated to finding a new culturally rich way of life in nature, away from the city, strongly believing that we can be source of culture ourselves instead of gravitating towards the cultural centres for new experiences and sensations.  

Evgenia's art practice emphesies experiences, she is a skilled designer of deep celebrations and rituals and is looking to develop this aspect in EarthSkyLab.

Evgenia is boundless energy, a source of beauty and light in the Universe...
